# Terms of Service

Last updated: February 28, 2026

## Informational service only

Before Your Advisor provides AI-assisted suggestions for informational purposes. It is not a CPA, law firm, tax preparer, or financial advisor, and no professional-client relationship is created by use of the service.

## No guarantee

AI outputs can be incomplete or inaccurate. You are responsible for reviewing all outputs and consulting a qualified professional before filing taxes or making legal or financial decisions.

## Acceptable use

You agree not to misuse the service, attempt unauthorized access, or submit content you do not have rights to process.

## Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the service is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties. Before Your Advisor and its operators are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenue, or data resulting from use of the service.
